              In my early years I would participate in a myriad of different academic challenges and accelerations much to my dislike and discomfort, but I think becoming uncomfortable is the only true way to understand something. Yet, I hadn’t figured out what I needed to understand. Many times when I had my head down in a text book I would much rather be in a fantasy land pertaining to the newest show that I had watched that evening prior. Although cumbersome I found outlets through activities such as the arts and reading. 
              I remember how much I used to read as a kid. Reading tales of far away lands today sound about as much as fiction as the stories themselves. Later my grandmother actually showed me the world wide web, and the lustrous world of video games. Her and I would often indulge ourselves in a point and click mysteries. A childhood saturated with adventure often found through a story or a click, I think that is what I learned to understand, or so I thought. I would be vicariously living through my imagination of an intra-perspective. We all can agree when we recall stories from the past because they made us feel a certain way. Sometimes painful, other times happy. In my late teens, and twenties all I remember to ever discuss in the pain.
              The overbearing guilt and responsibility of growing up in a traditional society where one is supposed to graduate from an institution, get a salary job, and have a family is just cliche. I think what I came to understand is how lonely I am for following a path that I never really decided fully for myself. After I graduated was that the flow of juxtaposition from a self that was seen by others, and a self that was made from that. I believe it is time to reclaim the future, my dreams, my ambition. What it means to be the architect of my own creation, and not destruction. I cannot meet your expectations, and therefore I do not require you to meet my own.

              I had been experimenting with Imagiro and their whole line up of VST’s since February. After my release of Alabaster 
              I wanted to revisit making something more abridged, and decided to make an April project that would be my thesis on 
              paper. I am trying to work with more people that make ambient music as well. During this period in my life I see myself 
              trying to juggle a lot, so this was some much needed balance. Writing piano first has been a staple in my sound design, 
              and I usually process ping pong delay, alongside a secondary granularized version of the initial piano sketch that I 
              write to give a nice feeling of enclosure with these melodies. The drums are always a struggle for me most of the time 
              so I decided to hit up one of my producer friends for some advice. He recommended that I scour the net in order to find 
              someone who may see my vision. I came across some potential candidates, but that is when I found the page China Poet on
               instagram. The emphasis on melodrama is just the tip of the iceberg. I especially appreciate the drums. Selectiveness 
               is something that is obsessive when I hear this producer's sounds. Everything is crafted to support their sound, but 
               enough so that each component has its own story, its own vitality, its own “something special”. Enough glazing, this 
               guy is someone you need to put on your radar. Recently I bought both of his kits, and I appreciate the “Game Like” 
               presence. Similar to a game that builds stories and character with texture and selectiveness. Isolation that’s joined 
               together in harmony. Alone in a room full of people. China Poet’s drums expounded on that idea, and I decided to use 
               these drums to fill the sections for my April project. I am currently working on a new edition to my discography which 
               will be a new drum kit that is much less of an imitation, but something that I can contribute to this idea. It will be 
               titled the “coloring book”. Super excited to release that in the near future.
